*** PopsDeco CC0 ***
I have seen applications like this but they didn't meet my need.
Only this meet both of these: 4.01 extract and free to redistribute.

Usage:
Put popsdeco folder to ms0(ef0):/PSP/GAME/
Put VER.pbp to ms0:/

0.06a.111111
Refined source structure.
pspdecrypt.prx is merged to libpsardumper.prx.
Somehow faster...?

0.06.111028
Added md5 check. path.txt is modifiable.

0.05a.110816 [6.60]
Now this uses the same backend as rev2.

Based on psardumper 6.39.
Finalized rev1.

0.04.110417 beta [6.36]
Based on psardumper 6.36.
Written readme.
Automated compilation.

0.03.110314 beta [6.20]
Test for popsloader PRO.
Based on psardumper 6.20.
If PSP version isn't 5.00, impose.prx isn't required any longer.

0.02.091222 [5.00]
Popsloader Extracter no longer stops when 401.pbp is not found, if
ms0:/seplugins/popsloader/impose.prx exists.
#It doesn't change the fact that popsloader requires impose.prx from 4.01.
Automatically mkdir ms0:/seplugins/popsloader

0.02.091221 alpha (not working)
Tried to merge prx to EBOOT.PBP (ineffective as the prx is kernel mode module)

0.01.091217 [5.00]
Written yet-another "popsloader extract" in 2 days...
As firmware decode sample.
